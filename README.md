# grow-nest-shop

I'm currently working on a personal project called Grow Nest Shop â€” a simple online store designed to showcase my frontend development skills using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how I structure interactive web applications, manage user interactions (like adding products to a shopping cart), and create responsive, user-friendly interfaces without relying on frameworks.

Features I'm building include:

A dynamic product listing loaded from Firebase
A fully functional shopping cart with persistent storage using localStorage
Custom styling with responsive layout
Modular, readable JavaScript code
This project is still in development, and I plan to continue expanding it by adding features like filtering, user authentication, and order management.
